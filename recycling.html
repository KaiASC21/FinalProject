                        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', 
                        making it look like readable English. Ima be honest, it got me. But there is recycling stuff in the google doc</p>

	   <h1>Tips to improve recycling</h1>
	   <div class = "tips">
		   <h2>TIP 1, No plastic bags:</h2>
		   <hr>
		   <p>
			Grocery bags dissolve into potentially harmful microplastics and, in the case of ingestion or entanglement, hurt and kill animals. Also, according to workers from recycling plants, plastic bags are the number-one contaminant in recycling loads. Plastic bags act as “tanglers,” getting caught in machinery and shutting down the equipment. On top of all this, in some places like Montgomery County, Maryland, when plastic bags full of recyclables arrive at the facility, workers are not allowed to open the bags. That means the entire bag, even if it’s full of water bottles, is considered trash. This basically means you shouldn’t bag your recyclables. Instead, dump them loosely right into your blue bins.

		   <h2>TIP 2, Size does matter:</h2>
		   <hr>
		   <p>
			Don’t recycle anything smaller than a credit card. That includes straws, bottlecaps, coffee pods, plastic cutlery, paperclips and a million other tiny things that might be deemed as recyclable. These objects are too small to be sorted and usually do no better than jamming the recycling equipment. For things like water bottles and jars, it is important for you to keep the bottle cap on so that the machine registers it as larger than a credit card. But on the topic of water bottles, this leads us to the next big tip.

		<h2>TIP 3, Keep it dry:</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Food waste acts as one of the biggest issues in terms of recycling. It contaminates whole loads of recyclable material, rendering them useless and causing them to just end up in landfills, the opposite of what we want. In the U.S, food waste contaminates 25 percent of our recycling loads. This makes it important to go and clean any resources you want to recycle. A quick rule of thumb for the cleaning, recyclable material should be clean enough to use again.

			<h2>TIP 4, They don't mix:</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Recycling only works when the same materials are together. Unfortunately, items with fused materials like plastic-coated coffee cups, laminated paper and paper-bubble wrap envelopes from the mail can’t ever be separated, which causes them to just be worthless. Try your best to avoid buying nonrecyclable materials that can’t be separated.
