	   <h1>Tips for Energy Saving</h1>
	   <div class = "tips">
		   <h2>TIP 1, Turn off what you're not using!:</h2>
		   <hr>
		   <p>
			To reduce energy consumption in your home, you donâ€™t necessarily need to go out and spend a fortune on energy efficient products. Energy conservation can be as simple as turning off lights or appliances when you do not need them. And if you want to go the extra mile you can reduce the use of machines that perform tasks that can be done by hand. Examples being: you can wash dishes by hand or let your clothes sit to dry instead of drying them in the dryer.
			</p>
	   </div>
	   <br>
	   <div class = "tips">
		   <h2>TIP 2, Change your lights!:</h2>
		   <hr>
		   <p>
			Traditional incandescent light bulbs consume an excessive amount of electricity and must be replaced more often than more modern energy efficient alternatives. Halogen incandescent bulbs, compact fluorescent lights (CFLs), and light-emitting diode bulbs (LEDs) use anywhere from 25-80 percent less electricity and last 3 to 25 times longer than traditional bulbs. Even though this sounds small, this is massive in terms of saving electricity. And it also takes very little/no maintenance to impliment. Just change your bulbs and start saving.

		<h2>TIP 3, Know your water heater:</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Water heating is a major contributor to your total energy consumption. Other than purchasing an energy efficient water heater, there are three methods of reducing your water heating expenses: you can simply use less hot water, turn down the thermostat on your water heater, or insulate your water heater and the first six feet of hot and cold water pipes. If you are considering replacing your water heater with an efficient model, you should keep in mind two factors: the type of water heater that meets your needs and the type of fuel it will use. For example, tankless water heaters are energy efficient, but they are also a poor choice for large families as they cannot handle multiple and simultaneous uses of hot water. Efficient water heaters can be anywhere between 8% and 300% more energy efficient than a conventional storage water heater.

			<h2>TIP 4, Make use of natural lighting:</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Another main user of energy consumption in most homes is lighting. Although changing light bulbs will help reduce the amount of energy you use drastically, There is a much simpler way. That method is just turning your lights off. During the day it is very useful to just keep your lights off and open your blinds, allowing natural sunlight to illuminate your home. By doing this, you'll be cutting the energy you use on lights down to a fraction with no risk or cost.
