	Climate Change
</h1>
<p class = "infotext">
	Let's start with defining the two words in climate change. Climate is the usual weather of a certain place. At times it is cold, but other times it is sunny and hot. The climate varies around the world. Earth's climate is the climate we get from combining all the climates in the world. Change means becoming something different, new, or unusual. Historically, Earth's climate has always been changing. The distance from the sun changes resulting in hotter and colder temperatures. However, this time it is caused by us humans. We burn coal, drive cars, emitting gases. The emittion of these gases are lethal changing the climate of Earth. It is predicted by scientists that Earth's temperature is on a rise for the next 100 years. As a result, icebergs will melt at a faster pace and ocean levels will rise. The effect of climate change is impacting millions of people. Rising sea levels causes the displacement of many people fromtheir homes, especially those living by the shore or on islands. This problem needs to be addressed right now, and can start with the individual efforts of you!

			<h3> What is the greenhouse gas effect and why is it deadly?</h3>
			<div class="answerbox">
				<div class="theanswer">
					<p> The greenhouse gas effect is an essential process for human life as it keeps the planet warm. It traps hot infrared radiation, which keeps the earth warm. However, with more geenhouse gases in the atmosphere more infrared radiation is trapped heating up Earth more.</p>

	   <h1>Tips to combat Climate Change</h1>
	   <div class = "tips">
		   <h2>TIP 1, Legs for Transportation:</h2>
		   <hr>
		   <p>
			   Try to avoid taking any motor vehicle when it is not necessary. Walking and biking are great alternatives. This decreases your carbon emission. Carbon is a greenhouse gas, which makes it very potenet. It causes the ozone layer, a protective layer form the sun, to deteriorate. Therefore, allowing more UV rays to pass the ozone layer. UV rays are deadly and can result in skin cancer and extinction of many species. If it is necessary to take a motor vehicle try car pooling or public transportation. They are great alternatives. Bonus: biking and walking are great way to exercise! Not skipping leg day :)

	   <div class = "tips">
		   <h2>TIP 2, No hurry for shipping</h2>
		   <hr>
		   <p>
				If you are not in a hurry don't select 1-day shipping. Have your package take their time. More trips are made by delivery trucks when buyers select expidited shipping. Using regular delivery would often mean that the truck or plane is more full, one trip with everything rather than multiple trips with little amount of goods. This is a way to reduce carbon emissions.
		   </p>
	   </div>
	   <br>
	   <div class = "tips">
		<h2>TIP 3, Save water:</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Energy is needed to produce water; the reason we have facuets is because of energy that helps transport water. By using less water you are reserving the water and indirectly requiring less energy. This can be done by turning of the faucet when brushing your teeth, taking shorter showers, not using excessive amoutns of water when preparing food. Reserving water is also important as some areas of the U.S. are going through periods of drought due to the lack of water. Places like California are struggling to provide a constant and large reserve of fresh water.
		</p>
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class = "tips">
			<h2>TIP 4, Unplug:</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				 Unplug any appliance when you are not using them. Leaving them plugged in will make them use up energy even when thay are just idle. Unplugging them may be a bit tedious, but you can use smart power strips. Smart power strips have buttons that stop and allow the flow of electricty. Electricty requires lots of power to produce; therefore, creating lots of waste. For example, oil is burned for electrcity resulting in lots of carbon emission into the atmosphere causing harmful impacts not only on humans, but wildlife as well.
