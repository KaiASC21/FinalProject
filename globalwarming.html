	Climate Change
</h1>
<p class = "infotext">
	Let's start with defining the two words in climate change. Climate is the usual weather of a certain place. At times it is cold, but other times it is sunny and hot. The climate varies around the world. Earth's climate is the climate we get from combining all the climates in the world. Change means becoming something different, new, or unusual. Historically, Earth's climate has always been changing. The distance from the sun changes resulting in hotter and colder temperatures. However, this time it is caused by us humans. We burn coal, drive cars, emitting gases. The emittion of these gases are lethal changing the climate of Earth. It is predicted by scientists that Earth's temperature is on a rise for the next 100 years. As a result, icebergs will melt at a faster pace and ocean levels will rise. The effect of climate change is impacting millions of people. Rising sea levels causes the displacement of many people fromtheir homes, especially those living by the shore or on islands. This problem needs to be addressed right now, and can start with the individual efforts of you!

                        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',

	   <h1>Tips to combat Climate Change</h1>
	   <div class = "tips">
		   <h2>TIP 1, Legs for Transportation:</h2>
		   <hr>
		   <p>
			   Try to avoid taking any motor vehicle when it is not necessary. Walking and biking are great alternatives. This decreases your carbon emission. Carbon is a greenhouse gas, which makes it very potenet. It causes the ozone layer, a protective layer form the sun, to deteriorate. Therefore, allowing more UV rays to pass the ozone layer. UV rays are deadly and can result in skin cancer and extinction of many species. If it is necessary to take a motor vehicle try car pooling or public transportation. They are great alternatives. Bonus: biking and walking are great way to exercise! Not skipping leg day :)

		   <h2>TIP 2, No hurry for shipping</h2>
		   <hr>
		   <p>
				If you are not in a hurry don't select 1-day shipping. Have your package take their time. More trips are made by delivery trucks when buyers select expidited shipping. This is a way to reduce carbon emissions.
