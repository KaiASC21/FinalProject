     Food Waste
</h1>
<p class = "infotext">
    Food waste is another problem we are fighting to change. Food waste targets a specific part about food loss . Food loss is the general loss of food that is being lost from it becoming spoiled or throughout any stage of it being picked in the fields to it being in someone's fridge. Food waste is our main target that we want to help reduce. Food waste is the food we humans throw away because of overproduction, bad weather, half eaten plates of food that people don't finish. Around 40% of America’s food goes to waste annually. That’s nearly around 125-160 pounds of food going to waste a year. In 2010 around 43 billion pounds of food went to waste from US retail alone. Retailers find this as a good practice to reduce the chances of overstocking in any area.

            <h2>TIP 4, Buy local:</h2>
            <p>
                 Buy locally sourced food. Local foods are often fresher and require less transportation, meaning lower carbon emissions. Compared to produce found in the supermarket local produce was often packaged with less plastic packagings, and less was damaged or wasted in the packaging process. Also, it is a great idea to support local businesses!
